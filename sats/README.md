# Satellites

Logs and tools for working satellites (amateur radio and others)

* `log.csv` is my logbook of heard and/or worked satellites. (If only heard,
  then `Freq Up` is left empty)
* `make_configs.py` - Generate config files for working with satellites:
  * Gpredict modules, organized by band, mode, and (eventually) worked status
